# Structurizr for Java

This GitHub repository is (1) a client library for the [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) cloud service and on-premises installation
and (2) a way to create a Structurizr workspace using Java code. Looking for the [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl) instead?

## A quick example

As an example, the following Java code can be used to create a software architecture __model__ and an associated __view__ that describes a user using a software system, based upon the [C4 model](https://c4model.com).

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Workspace workspace = new Workspace("Getting Started", "This is a model of my software system.");
    Model model = workspace.getModel();
    
    Person user = model.addPerson("User", "A user of my software system.");
    SoftwareSystem softwareSystem = model.addSoftwareSystem("Software System", "My software system.");
    user.uses(softwareSystem, "Uses");
    
    ViewSet views = workspace.getViews();
    SystemContextView contextView = views.createSystemContextView(softwareSystem, "SystemContext", "An example of a System Context diagram.");
    contextView.addAllSoftwareSystems();
    contextView.addAllPeople();
}
```

The view can then be exported to be visualised using the [Structurizr cloud service/on-premises installation/Lite](https://structurizr.com),
or other formats including PlantUML, Mermaid, DOT, and WebSequenceDiagrams via the [structurizr-export library](https://github.com/structurizr/export).
